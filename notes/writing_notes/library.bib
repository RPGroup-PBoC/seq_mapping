abstract = {Position weight matrices (PWMs) are the standard model for DNA and RNA regulatory motifs. In PWMs nucleotide probabilities are independent of nucleotides at other positions. Models that account for dependencies need many parameters and are prone to overfitting. We have developed a Bayesian approach for motif discovery using Markov models in which conditional probabilities of order k - 1 act as priors for those of order k This Bayesian Markov model (BaMM) training automatically adapts model complexity to the amount of available data. We also derive an EM algorithm for de-novo discovery of enriched motifs. For transcription factor binding, BaMMs achieve significantly (P = 1/16) higher cross-validated partial AUC than PWMs in 97{\%} of 446 ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and improve performance by 36{\%} on average. BaMMs also learn complex multipartite motifs, improving predictions of transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, bacterial pause sites, and RNA binding sites by 26-101{\%}. BaMMs never performed worse than PWMs. These robust improvements argue in favour of generally replacing PWMs by BaMMs.},

This paper is quite technical--may want to pass on to Bill, and revisit once I have learned some more about Markov modeling and Bayesian methods. Presents a Bayesian approach for learning sequence motifs that they claim performs better than basic PWMs.

In regards to Onew, could be a valuable reference for discussing model performance. In particular, it is interesting that their PWMs perform so poorly for weak, multiply-mutated sites (see Figure 4). We will have to determine whether we can make an easy comparison...perhaps by measuring a few O3 mutants? May also want to try looking at log ratios, as they did. Additionally, they claim the ability to accurately predict binding affinities and TSSs, as well as other features that are less relevant to our study.},

abstract = {Knowing the specificity of transcription factors is critical to understanding regulatory networks in cells. The lac repressor-operator system has been studied for many years, but not with high-throughput methods capable of determining specificity comprehensively. Details of its binding interaction and its selection of an asymmetric binding site have been controversial. We employed a new method to accurately determine relative binding affinities to thousands of sequences simultaneously, requiring only sequencing of bound and unbound fractions. An analysis of 2560 different DNA sequence variants, including both base changes and variations in operator length, provides a detailed view of lac repressor sequence specificity. We find that the protein can bind with nearly equal affinities to operators of three different lengths, but the sequence preference changes depending on the length, demonstrating alternative modes of interaction between the protein and DNA. The wild-type operator has an odd length, causing the two monomers to bind in alternative modes, making the asymmetric operator the preferred binding site. We tested two other members of the LacI/GalR protein family and find that neither can bind with high affinity to sites with alternative lengths or shows evidence of alternative binding modes. A further comparison with known and predicted motifs suggests that the lac repressor may be unique in this ability and that this may contribute to its selection.},

Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

It provides an accurate quantification of the fraction of the population bound by a nucleosome and captures distinct, even adjacent, TF binding events. By applying this assay to over 1,500 promoter variants in yeast, we reveal pronounced differences in the dependency of TF activity on chromatin and classify TFs by their differential capacity to alter chromatin and promote expression. We further demonstrate how different regulatory sequences give rise to nucleosome-mediated TF collaborations that quantitatively account for the resulting expression.},

abstract = {Many cellular functions depend on highly specific intermolecular interactions, for example transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, microRNAs and their RNA binding sites, the interfaces between heterodimeric protein molecules, the stems in RNA molecules, and kinases and their response regulators in signal-transduction systems. Despite the need for complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity conflicts with selective pressure for greater interaction, situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with larger numbers of interacting partners are subject to increased levels of evolutionary conservation, their more numerous partners need not converge on a single sequence motif or be increasingly constrained in more complex systems. These results suggest that most phylogenetic differences in the sequences of binding interfaces are not the result of adaptive fine tuning but a simple consequence of random genetic drift.},

In equilibrium, limited specificity may lead to crosstalk: a regulatory state in which a gene is either incorrectly activated due to noncognate TF-DNA interactions or remains erroneously inactive. We present a tractable biophysical model of global crosstalk, where many genes are simultaneously regulated by many TFs. We show that in the simplest regulatory scenario, a lower bound on crosstalk severity can be analytically derived solely from the number of (co)regulated genes and a suitable parameter that describes binding site similarity. Estimates show that crosstalk could present a significant challenge for organisms with low-specificity TFs, such as metazoans, unless they use appropriate regulation schemes. Strong cooperativity substantially decreases crosstalk, while joint regulation by activators and repressors, surprisingly, does not; moreover, certain microscopic details about promoter architecture emerge as globally important determinants of crosstalk strength. Our results suggest that crosstalk imposes a new type of global constraint on the functioning and evolution of regulatory networks, which is qualitatively distinct from the known constraints acting at the level of individual gene regulatory elements.},

abstract = {Cells use protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to regulate transcription. A biophysical understanding of this process has, however, been limited by the lack of methods for quantitatively characterizing the interactions that occur at specific promoters and enhancers in living cells. Here we show how such biophysical information can be revealed by a simple experiment in which a library of partially mutated regulatory sequences are partitioned according to their in vivo transcriptional activities and then sequenced en masse. Computational analysis of the sequence data produced by this experiment can provide precise quantitative information about how the regulatory proteins at a specific arrangement of binding sites work together to regulate transcription. This ability to reliably extract precise information about regulatory biophysics in the face of experimental noise is made possible by a recently identified relationship between likelihood and mutual information. Applying our experimental and computational techniques to the Escherichia coli lac promoter, we demonstrate the ability to identify regulatory protein binding sites de novo, determine the sequence-dependent binding energy of the proteins that bind these sites, and, importantly, measure the in vivo interaction energy between RNA polymerase and a DNA-bound transcription factor. Our approach provides a generally applicable method for characterizing the biophysical basis of transcriptional regulation by a specified regulatory sequence. The principles of our method can also be applied to a wide range of other problems in molecular biology.},
