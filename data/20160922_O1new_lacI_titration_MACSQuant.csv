# Date : 2016-09-21
# Equipment : MACSQuant (Bjorkman lab)
# Description : 
# LacI titration with 6 different operators (O1new005, O1new009, O1new010, 01new012, O1new013, O1new014) 
# and 7 different RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# Comments : 
# Things looks fine. Flow rate was the usual 3000/sec-6000/sec
