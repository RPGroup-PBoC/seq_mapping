# Equipment : MACSQuant (Bjorkman lab)
# Description : 
# LacI titration with 5 different operators (O1new007, O1new008, O1new010, O1new011, 
# O1new013, and 01new014) 
# and 7 different RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# Comments : 
# Things looks fine. 
# 010 is actualy the old strain set where HG104 and delta are backwards 
# and the rbs strains are in HG104.
# Will have to repeat 010, but for now I analyze and assume the rbs strains are okay.
