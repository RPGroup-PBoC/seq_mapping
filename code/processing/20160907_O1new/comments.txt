# Equipment : MACSQuant (Bjorkman lab)
# Description : 
# LacI titration with 5 different operators (O1new007, O1new008, O1new010, O1new011, 
# O1new013, and 01new014) 
# and 7 different RBS (delta, HG104, RBS1147, RBS446, RBS1027, RBS1 and RBS1L)
# Comments : 
# The flow rates were very low - about 1000/sec with high flow selected.
# We also had to cancel part way through due to the slow speed, so the next person
# could use the machine. The last three operators were not completed.
